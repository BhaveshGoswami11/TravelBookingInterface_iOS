## 🧭 App Flow

### 1. **Booking Screen (BookingViewController)**
- Users input:
  - Traveler’s Name  
  - Number of Travelers  
  - Cabin Type  
- On tapping **Book Now**, input validation checks are performed.
- If valid, it navigates to the **Result Screen** using a storyboard segue.

### 2. **Result Screen (ResultViewController)**
- Displays the calculated total cost and booking confirmation.
- Shows appropriate images:
  - `economy.png` → for economy class  
  - `luxury.png` → for luxury class  
  - `invalid.png` → for invalid input
